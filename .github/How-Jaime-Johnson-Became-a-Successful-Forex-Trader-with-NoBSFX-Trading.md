Johnson started his trading career in 2000, after graduating from college with a degree in finance. He was fascinated by the forex market and its potential for high returns. He learned everything he could about technical analysis, chart patterns, indicators, and trading strategies. He also experimented with different trading systems and methods, trying to find the best way to trade the forex market.
 
However, he soon realized that most of the information and advice he found online was either outdated, misleading, or plain wrong. He also discovered that many of the trading systems and indicators he used were too complicated, inconsistent, or unreliable. He wasted a lot of time and money on things that did not work or made his trading worse.
 
He decided to take a different approach. He simplified his trading by focusing on the most important factors: price action, trend, support and resistance, and risk management. He also developed his own trading style and rules, based on his personality, goals, and preferences. He called his method NoBSFX Trading, which stands for No Bullshit Forex Trading.
 
NoBSFX Trading is a simple and effective way to trade the forex market. It does not rely on any indicators, signals, robots, or guru opinions. It only uses price charts and common sense. It teaches traders how to identify high-probability trade setups, how to enter and exit trades with confidence, how to manage risk and reward, and how to develop a winning mindset.
 
Johnson has been teaching his NoBSFX Trading method to thousands of traders around the world since 2008. He has also created several courses and tools to help traders learn and apply his method. Some of his products include:
 
- NoBSFX Trading Workshop: A comprehensive online course that covers everything from the basics of forex trading to advanced topics such as market structure, trend analysis, price patterns, trade management, psychology, and more.
