## What to Expect from The Suicide Squad Sequel
 
If you enjoyed watching Suicide Squad in Hindi online, you might be wondering if there will be a sequel to the film. The good news is that there is already a sequel out in theaters and on HBO Max, called The Suicide Squad. The bad news is that it is not available in Hindi yet, and there is no official confirmation on when it will be.
 
The Suicide Squad is a standalone sequel to Suicide Squad, meaning that it is not a direct continuation of the previous film's story, but it does feature some of the same characters and actors. The film is written and directed by James Gunn, who is known for his work on the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. The film has received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its humor, action, and style.
 
The plot of The Suicide Squad follows a new team of convicts who are sent to the island of Corto Maltese to destroy a secret weapon known as Project Starfish. Along the way, they face various enemies and challenges, as well as their own personal demons. The film has a larger and more diverse cast than the first one, including Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker, Sylvester Stallone as King Shark, and many more.
 
As for the future of the Suicide Squad franchise, there is no official announcement of a third film yet. However, there are some spin-offs and related projects in development. One of them is Peacemaker, a TV series starring John Cena as his character from The Suicide Squad. The series will explore the origins and adventures of Peacemaker, who is described as \"a douchey Captain America\" by Gunn. The series will premiere on HBO Max in January 2022.
 
Another project that could be related to the Suicide Squad franchise is Gotham City Sirens, a film that would focus on the female villains of Gotham City, such as Harley Quinn, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy. The film was originally announced in 2016 with David Ayer as director and Margot Robbie as producer and star. However, the project has been put on hold since then, and there is no update on its status or release date.
 
In conclusion, if you are a fan of Suicide Squad and want to watch more of its characters and stories, you have some options to look forward to. You can watch The Suicide Squad in English online or wait for its Hindi release. You can also watch Peacemaker on HBO Max next year or hope for Gotham City Sirens to come out someday. Until then, you can always rewatch Suicide Squad in Hindi online and enjoy its action and humor.
